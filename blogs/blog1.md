<h2 style="color: #245ab3;">Reasoning in LLMs</h2>

I am tired of making LLMs reason for my app.This is so frustating.I've been trying to utilize LLM to decide which of 2 submissions is a better submission i.e declare a winner based on juding criteria.It feels like the more the LLM outputs the more it gets closer to reasoning.if you ask it to reason in a single output it maybe unable to reason but if you break it down, maybe ask it to assign points to criterias or ask it to describle pros and cons and then compare submissions,it might performs significantly better. OR maybe assign a advocate for each of the submissions who would vouch for them and a judge who would give the final verdict.
